It will give you peace of mind, and you will feel the connection that most of us are now searching for in all the materialistic things like fame and money. In Islam, you have a direct connection with Allah(God) and don’t have to go to the middle man to reach your God or talk to your God. In Islam, worship is only for Allah(God). Muslims don’t worship prophets, saints anything other than Allah(God). Yeah, that was some of the reasons that make Islam the answer to our problems and difficulties.","IslamID":1,"IslamFact":"1 Allah(God)","IslamImageName":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FaisalSul/JSONProjectIT315/main/islam.jpg?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACCESOZPZ5W6Y2NMIQ4REHNGZCRWB4Q","IslamWebSiteAddress":"https://www.onemessagefoundation.com/why-islam"},	  
    {"IslamName":"Quran","IslamDescription":"Quran the Holly and sacred book of Islam. Muslims believe that  Allah(God) revealed his direct words through Angel Jibril to the Prophet Mohammad(Peace be upon him) and that is the Quran. The Quran is the complete way of life. It consists of everything, and it gives clear rules and teaches people to follow and live a righteous life according to the Quran with the understanding of Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him) and his companions. Many people think that you can take any understanding of the Quran but that is totally wrong. Muslims believe that we should only follow the way how the Prophet Mohammad(PBUH) and his companions understood the Quran.","IslamID":4,"IslamFact":"Quran was completed in 23 years","IslamImageName":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FaisalSul/JSONProjectIT315/main/quran.jpg?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACCESOZP7ES6JEW6IQ2H5AHQZCRWLGA","IslamWebSiteAddress":"https://quran.com/"},
